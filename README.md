# Manual Installation
*This plugin requires BSIPA which you will automatically get when you run [ModAssistant](https://github.com/Assistant/ModAssistant/releases).*

1. Make sure that Beat Saber is not running.
2. Extract the contents of the zip into Beat Saber's installation folder.
	For Oculus Home: `\Oculus Apps\Software\hyperbolic-magnetism-beat-saber\`
	For Steam: `\steamapps\common\Beat Saber\`
		(The folder that contains Beat Saber.exe)
4. Done! You've installed the Discord Presence Plugin.

# Building the project yourself
I haven't included the discord-rpc.dll that is required in source, so you need to get it yourself here: https://github.com/discordapp/discord-rpc/releases

If you need help, ask us at the Beat Saber Mod Group Discord Server:
